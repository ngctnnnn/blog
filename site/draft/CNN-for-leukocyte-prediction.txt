Data analysis on number of blood cells, which are white blood cells and red blood cells in details, per a certain blood volume could help us observe our medical situation. In this blog, we introduce a faster method to recognize disease via the number of leukocytes.

#### 1. Introduction

While blood cells (WBC), also known as leukocytes, are produced in the bone marrow and composed of nuclei and cytoplasm. WBCs are divided into five groups: basophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, monocyte and neutrophil. Leukocytes protects the body against infectious disease and foreign substance, constitute an important part of the immune system. 4.1e9 to 11.1e9 units in one liter of a healthy adult human is the normal number of WBCs in a blood is 4,500 to 11,000 WBCs per microliter and a drop in a blood is 7,000 to 25,000. 

| Name | Image | Description | 
|------|-------|-------------| 
| Neutrophils  | None | Its role is to reach the place of the microbial invasion, to phagocytize and to destry the invading organism. |
| Eosinophils  | None | Part of the defense mechanism against parasitic infections, inflammatory processes and allergic tissue reactions. |
| Basophils    | None | They play a role in the states involed in allergic and immediate hypersensitivity reactions.| 
| Monocytes    | None | Involved in defensive reactions to some microorganisms, remove damaged cells and cell debris. They have a bactericidal action as immune reaction| 
| Lymphocytes  | None | The lymphocytes produce antibodies and are involved in immune reactions| 

#### 2. Dataset and data preprocessing 
The [LISC - *Leukocyte Images for Segmentation and Classification*](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hrezatofighi/Data/Leukocyte%20Data.htm) is used for automatic identification and blood cells counting.
