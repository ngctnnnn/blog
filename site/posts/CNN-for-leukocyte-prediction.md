The power of applied computer vision has been proved to be extraordinarily effective on many fields and medical is one of those. In this research Convolutional Neural Network is utilized as a tool to predict diseases via classifying blood cells to count leukocyte in the respiratory system.

#### 1. Introduction

While blood cells (WBC), also called leukocytes which one are produced in the bone marrow and composed of nuclei and cytoplasm. WBCs are divided into five groups: basophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, monocyte and neutrophil. Leukocytes protects the body against infectious disease and foreign substanse, consitute an important part of the immune system. 4.1e9 to 11.1e9 units in one liter of a healthy adult human that is the normal number of WBCs in a blood is 4,500 to 11,000 WBCs per microliter and a drop in a blood is 7,000 to 25,000.
