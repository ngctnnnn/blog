The power of applied computer vision has been proved to be extraordinarily effective on many fields and medical is one of those. In this research, i used Convolutional Neural Network as a tool to predict diseases via classifying blood cells to count leukocyte in the respiratory system.

#### 1. Introduction


#### 2. Dataset 

The [LISC - *Leukocyte Images for Segmentation and Classification*](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hrezatofighi/Data/Leukocyte%20Data.htm) has been used for automatic identification and counting of blood cells

Samples were taken from peripheral blood of 8 normal subjects and 400 samples were obtained from 100 microscope slides. The microscope slides were smeared and stained by Gismo-Right technique and images were acquired by a light microscope (Microscope-Axioskope 40) from the stained peripheral blood using an achromatic lens with a magnification of 100. Then, these images were recorded by a digital camera (Sony Model No. SSCDC50AP) and were saved in the BMP format. The images contain 720Ã—576 pixels.
All of them are color images and were collected from Hematology-Oncology and BMT Research Center of Imam Khomeini hospital in Tehran, Iran. The images were classified by a hematologist into normal leukocytes: **basophil**, **eosinophil**, **lymphocyte**, **monocyte**, and **neutrophil**. Also, the areas related to the nucleus and cytoplasm were manually segmented by an expert.
