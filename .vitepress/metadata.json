That is why we have to take our actions immediately in order to cope with this pandemic. And the very first step in getting through this pandemic is that we have to rapidly identify COVID-19 cases. Thus, we propose a rapidly testing method which has a high productivity in a short time, which is to use Deep Convolutional Neural Network to detect COVID-19 on Chest X-ray (CXR) images.    \n\nDetailed implementation and experiments: [ngctnnnn/Detect-COVID19](https://github.com/ngctnnnn/Detect-COVID19).\n\n"},{"title":"Reflections for 2020-2021","href":"/posts/hello-2021.html","date":{"time":1610366400000,"string":"January 11, 2021"},"excerpt":"\nWith a new year upon us, we also have a new blog!
