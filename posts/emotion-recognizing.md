#### 1. Introduction
There is a large number of neural networks nowadays to help us in almost every aspect of our life. In addition, we realize that different problems often require different types of networks. In this problem, I choose to use VGGFace network, or it is also called as Deep Face architecture.  

VGGFace architecture was first introduced to solve the problem of recognizing humans' face (i think it is called as Deep Face at first due to that reason, in my opinion).
